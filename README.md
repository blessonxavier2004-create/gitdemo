task 01:
Basic Arithmetic Calculator:
A simple, beginner-friendly Python script that performs the four fundamental mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 Description:
This project demonstrates the basics of Python programming, including:

User Input: Capturing data using the input() function.

Type Casting: Converting string inputs into integers using int().

Arithmetic Operators: Using +, -, *, and /.

Output: Formatting and displaying results to the console.
Code Logic
The script executes the following logic:
Prompts the user for two numbers.Stores the numbers as integers.
Calculates the results:
Sum: a + b
Difference: a - b
Product: a * b
Quotient: a \ b
 task 02:
 User Greeting Script
A simple Python program that demonstrates how to collect individual string inputs and combine them into a formatted greeting message.

Description
This script focuses on String Concatenation and F-Strings. It takes two separate inputs (first name and last name) and merges them to create a personalized welcome message for a Python course assignment.

 How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Run the script in your terminal

🛠️ Key Concepts
input(): Used to capture text data from the user.

Concatenation: Combining strings using the + operator (e.g., a + " " + b).

F-Strings: Using f"..." to inject variables directly into a string for cleaner output.

 Logic Flow
Input A: User enters their first name.

Input B: User enters their last name.

Process: The script adds a space between the two names and stores them in variable c.

Output: A formatted greeting is printed using an f-string.
